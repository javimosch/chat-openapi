# Vector Storage FAQ (Phase 2.3)

## General Questions

### Q: How does the vector storage system work?

The system works in three main steps:

1. **Text to Vector Conversion**:
   - Uses sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
   - Converts text chunks into 384-dimensional vectors
   - Preserves semantic meaning of text

2. **Storage**:
   - Vectors stored in Qdrant database
   - Metadata and original text preserved
   - Organized by specification ID

3. **Retrieval**:
   - Converts search query to vector
   - Finds similar vectors using cosine similarity
   - Returns most relevant chunks

### Q: What are the system's limitations?

1. **Performance Limitations**:
   - Maximum 100 chunks per batch
   - Vector search latency: ~50-100ms
   - Memory usage scales with number of vectors

2. **Size Limitations**:
   - Individual chunk size: 2048 tokens
   - Maximum spec size: 100MB
   - Maximum chunks per spec: 10,000

3. **Search Limitations**:
   - Single language model
   - No multi-language support
   - Limited to text similarity

### Q: How accurate is the vector search?

The accuracy depends on several factors:

1. **Query Quality**:
   - Precise queries work better
   - Context improves results
   - Technical terms are well-handled

2. **Content Type**:
   - API descriptions: Very accurate
   - Code snippets: Moderately accurate
   - Complex schemas: Variable accuracy

3. **Typical Performance**:
   - Top-1 accuracy: ~85%
   - Top-5 accuracy: ~95%
   - Relevance score > 0.8 is highly reliable

### Q: What happens when things go wrong?

1. **Storage Failures**:
   - Failed chunks are logged
   - Retries for transient errors
   - Original file preserved
   - Error details in logs

2. **Search Failures**:
   - Fallback to simpler search
   - Error messages returned
   - Default to empty results
   - Logs for debugging

3. **System Issues**:
   - Automatic reconnection
   - Data consistency checks
   - Health monitoring

### Q: How scalable is the system?

1. **Current Limits**:
   - Up to 1M vectors per collection
   - 5,000 requests per minute
   - 100GB storage capacity

2. **Scaling Factors**:
   - Memory usage: ~500 bytes per vector
   - CPU: Linear with search volume
   - Storage: Linear with data volume

3. **Bottlenecks**:
   - Embedding generation speed
   - Vector search performance
   - Memory constraints

### Q: How is data consistency maintained?

1. **Storage Process**:
   - Atomic operations
   - Batch transaction-like behavior
   - Metadata validation
   - ID collision prevention

2. **Updates**:
   - Overwrite protection
   - Version tracking
   - Backup before update
   - Rollback capability

3. **Deletion**:
   - Cascade deletion
   - Reference checking
   - Cleanup verification
   - Audit logging

### Q: What about resource usage?

1. **Memory Usage**:
   ```
   Base memory: ~500MB
   Per 10k vectors: +50MB
   Model cache: ~1GB
   ```

2. **CPU Usage**:
   ```
   Embedding generation: High
   Vector search: Moderate
   Background tasks: Low
   ```

3. **Storage**:
   ```
   Vector data: ~500B per vector
   Metadata: ~1KB per chunk
   Index overhead: ~20%
   ```

### Q: How is performance optimized?

1. **Search Optimization**:
   - Indexed vector storage
   - Cached embeddings
   - Batch processing
   - Query optimization

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Memory-mapped files
   - Connection pooling
   - Load balancing
   - Resource limits

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Model weights
   - Frequent queries
   - Metadata
   - Search results

### Q: What about security?

1. **Data Protection**:
   - No PII in vectors
   - Encrypted storage
   - Access control
   - Audit logging

2. **Operation Security**:
   - Input validation
   - Resource limits
