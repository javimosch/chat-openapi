# Chat with OpenAPI - Technical Specifications

This document outlines three viable technical stack proposals for implementing the "Chat with OpenAPI" application, filtered and validated against our [criteria.md](criteria.md) requirements.

## Core Requirements

- Upload and parse OpenAPI specification JSON files
- Split specifications into meaningful chunks
- Store chunks in a vector database
- Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Integration with OpenRouter for LLM capabilities
- Environment configuration via .env files
- Docker Compose support
- Tailwind CSS integration
- MongoDB support for future features
- Streaming support for LLM responses

## Tech Stack Proposals

### Proposal 1: Python FastAPI + Qdrant Stack (Recommended)

#### Components:
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant (open-source, written in Rust)
- **Text Chunking**: LangChain
- **Frontend**: Vue.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Future Database**: MongoDB
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI (built-in with FastAPI)
- **Environment Management**: python-dotenv
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

#### Advantages:
- FastAPI has excellent built-in support for streaming responses (crucial for OpenRouter)
- python-dotenv provides robust .env handling
- Vue.js has first-class Tailwind CSS support
- Motor (MongoDB async driver) works perfectly with FastAPI
- LangChain provides robust streaming support for LLMs

#### Considerations:
- Requires careful container orchestration
- Need to properly configure CORS for development

### Proposal 2: Node.js + ChromaDB Stack

#### Components:
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **Text Processing**: LangChain.js
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Future Database**: MongoDB
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI
- **Environment Management**: dotenv
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

#### Advantages:
- Next.js provides excellent Tailwind integration
- Native MongoDB support in Node.js
- ChromaDB is lightweight and easy to configure
- dotenv is battle-tested in Node.js ecosystem

#### Considerations:
- Need to ensure proper streaming setup with OpenRouter
- ChromaDB requires careful memory management

### Proposal 3: Python Django + Weaviate Stack

#### Components:
- **Backend Framework**: Django + Django REST Framework + Django Channels
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate
- **Text Processing**: LangChain
- **Frontend**: Nuxt.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Future Database**: MongoDB
- **API Documentation**: drf-spectacular
- **Environment Management**: django-environ
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

#### Advantages:
- Django Channels provides robust WebSocket support for streaming
- django-environ handles .env files seamlessly
- Nuxt.js has built-in Tailwind support
- Weaviate offers excellent scaling capabilities

#### Considerations:
- More complex initial setup
- Need to configure Django Channels properly for streaming

## Removed Proposals

### Go + ChromaDB Stack (Removed)
Removed due to:
- Limited mature libraries for .env handling in Go
- Less straightforward integration with Tailwind
- More complex MongoDB integration compared to other stacks
- Limited streaming support libraries for OpenRouter

## Recommended Approach

Based on the criteria evaluation, **Proposal 1 (Python FastAPI + Qdrant Stack)** remains the recommended choice because:

1. FastAPI provides native async support for streaming responses
2. python-dotenv offers robust environment management
3. Vue.js + Tailwind CSS integration is straightforward
4. MongoDB integration via motor is well-supported
5. All components have excellent Docker support
6. LangChain provides mature streaming support for OpenRouter

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up Docker Compose with services:
   - FastAPI application
   - Qdrant vector database
   - Vue.js frontend
   - MongoDB (prepared for future)

2. Configure environment:
   - Create .env file structure
   - Set up environment validation
   - Configure Docker Compose env handling

3. Implement core functionalities:
   - OpenAPI spec upload and validation
   - Text chunking with LangChain
   - Vector storage in Qdrant
   - Streaming RAG implementation
   - OpenRouter integration with streaming

4. Create frontend:
   - Set up Vue.js with Tailwind CSS
   - Implement file upload interface
   - Create streaming chat interface
   - Add API documentation viewer

## Security Considerations

- Secure .env file management
- OpenRouter API key protection
- MongoDB credential security
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input sanitization

## Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal scaling via Docker Swarm/Kubernetes
- Caching layer for frequent queries
- MongoDB replication support
- Batch processing for large specs
