# Technical Stack Evaluation Criteria

## Must-Have Requirements

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Must support `.env` file loading for configuration management
- Must handle sensitive data (OpenRouter API keys, database credentials)
- Must work within Docker containers

### 2. Container Orchestration
- Must support Docker Compose
- Must allow multi-container setup
- Must enable service dependencies and networking
- Must support volume mounting for persistence

### 3. Frontend Styling
- Must support Tailwind CSS integration
- Must allow for modern, responsive design
- Must work with the chosen frontend framework

### 4. Database Requirements
- Must support MongoDB integration for future features
- MongoDB will store:
  - Chat history
  - User sessions
  - Application metadata
- Must be containerized via Docker Compose

### 5. LLM Integration
- Must support OpenRouter API integration
- Must handle streaming responses
- Must manage API rate limits and quotas
- Must support async operations for better performance

## Evaluation Matrix

| Requirement Category | Weight | Success Criteria |
|---------------------|--------|------------------|
| Env Configuration   | High   | Native or well-maintained library support for .env |
| Docker Compose      | High   | All components must be containerizable |
| Tailwind Support    | Medium | Direct integration with frontend framework |
| MongoDB Support     | Low    | Native or well-maintained drivers available |
| OpenRouter          | High   | REST API client capability with streaming |

## Implementation Priorities

1. MVP Components (Required):
   - OpenAPI spec upload and processing
   - Vector database integration
   - RAG implementation
   - OpenRouter integration
   - Basic chat interface

2. Future Features (Post-MVP):
   - MongoDB integration
   - Chat history
   - User sessions
   - Enhanced UI/UX

## Technical Constraints

1. Environment Setup:
   - All sensitive configuration must be via .env files
   - No hardcoded credentials
   - Environment variables must be properly passed to containers

2. Container Architecture:
   - Services must be defined in docker-compose.yml
   - Must support local development
   - Must be production-ready capable

3. Frontend Development:
   - Tailwind CSS must be properly configured
   - Must support hot reloading
   - Must be buildable for production

4. Database Integration:
   - MongoDB must be optional for MVP
   - Must support future scaling
   - Must handle connection pooling

5. LLM Integration:
   - Must handle API timeouts gracefully
   - Must support streaming responses
   - Must be cost-effective
