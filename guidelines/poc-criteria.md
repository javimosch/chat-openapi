# POC Development Criteria

## Overview
This document outlines the guidelines and principles for developing Proof of Concept (POC) features in our project. POC mode should be explicitly requested and follows a "minimum viable implementation" approach to quickly deliver testable features.

## Core Principles

### 1. Minimal Implementation
- Implement only the bare minimum required for a working version of a feature
- Focus on core functionality over additional features
- Skip non-essential optimizations and complex error handling
- Prioritize speed of implementation over perfection

### 2. System Simplification
- Use simple, direct implementations instead of complex systems
- Implement essential steps only
- Avoid over-engineering and excessive abstraction
- Choose straightforward solutions over sophisticated ones

### 3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Favor simple, clear solutions
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Use standard libraries and tools when possible
- Keep the codebase easily understandable

### 4. Time-to-Value Focus
- Minimize development time
- Prioritize features that can be tested by end users
- Focus on delivering tangible results quickly
- Avoid perfectionism in favor of functionality

### 5. End-to-End Implementation
- Build complete features from frontend to backend
- Ensure the feature is usable by end users
- Focus on the user experience over internal elegance
- Deliver working solutions rather than perfect architecture

## Examples

### Good POC Approach: Chat Feature
✅ DO:
- Implement basic message sending and receiving
- Create a simple UI for interaction
- Use basic storage solution
- Focus on core chat functionality
- Deploy a working end-to-end solution

❌ DON'T:
- Build complex message queuing systems
- Implement extensive error handling
- Create sophisticated UI animations
- Add non-essential features
- Over-optimize performance

## Metaphor
"Give a new paint to a car instead of replacing the motor"

This metaphor emphasizes:
- Focus on visible improvements
- Quick, effective changes
- User-facing enhancements
- Avoiding complex internal changes
- Delivering immediate value

## When to Use POC Mode
- For rapid feature validation
- When testing new concepts
- During early development phases
- For user feedback collection
- In time-constrained situations

## Success Criteria
A successful POC should:
- Be functional end-to-end
- Provide value to end users
- Be completed quickly
- Demonstrate the core concept
- Enable user testing and feedback

## Post-POC Considerations
- Gather user feedback
- Identify necessary improvements
- Plan full implementation if needed
- Document learnings and limitations
- Evaluate technical debt trade-offs

Remember: The goal of a POC is to quickly deliver something useful that can be tested by users, not to build the perfect solution.
