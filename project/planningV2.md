# OpenAPI Chat - POC Planning V2

## Strategy
Following POC development criteria:
- Minimal Implementation: Focus only on core chat functionality
- System Simplification: Direct, straightforward implementations
- KISS Principle: Simple, clear solutions without over-engineering
- Time-to-Value: Quick delivery of testable features
- End-to-End Focus: Complete, usable features from frontend to backend

## Web Chat Interface POC
### Core Features
- Basic chat interface with message history
  - Simple text input and output
  - Minimal styling for readability
  - Basic mobile responsiveness

- Message streaming implementation
  - WebSocket-based streaming
  - Basic reconnection handling
  - Simple error display

- Context display
  - Toggle button to show/hide context
  - Basic formatting of context information

### Required Backend APIs
1. WebSocket endpoint `/chat/ws`
   - Basic message streaming
   - Simple error handling
   - Connection management

2. REST endpoints
   - `/chat/context`: Get relevant context
   - `/health`: Basic health check

## Timeline
- Basic UI Implementation: 3 days
- WebSocket Integration: 2 days
- Context Display: 1 day
- Testing & Fixes: 1 day

Total POC Timeline: ~1 week

## Success Criteria
1. Users can send messages and receive streaming responses
2. Context can be viewed when needed
3. Basic mobile usability
4. Stable WebSocket connection with simple recovery
5. End-to-end functionality works reliably

## Next Steps After POC
Based on POC feedback, we'll determine which areas need enhancement:
- Performance optimizations
- UI/UX improvements
- Additional features
- System management tools
