## Dependencies Between Tasks
- Logging system should be implemented before any other backend features
- File upload must be completed before CLI file operations
- CLI file operations must be completed before text chunking
- Vector storage must be ready before RAG implementation
- CLI chat operations require OpenRouter and RAG
- Frontend components depend on their respective backend endpoints

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 1 day
- Phase 2: 2 days
- Phase 3: 2 days
- Phase 3.5: 1 day
- Phase 3.6: 1 day
- Phase 4: 2 days
- Phase 5: 1 day

Total MVP Implementation: ~10 days
